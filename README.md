# Ninja Spect Learning
## About
Ninja Spect was created to enhance online education and help students love learning. Unlike most learning platforms, Ninja Spect covers many fundamental subjects and creates a deep understanding of these subjects through games, videos and interactive lessons. We can almost guarantee that your school, student or child will enjoy Ninja Spect and make the most out of it.

## Maths
[Maths](https://ninjaspect.github.io/Maths) is under development but it will be the first core subject to be released after [Coding](https://ninjaspect.github.io/Coding)!

## Reading
Reading is yet to come!

## Writing
We have a special way to train students for Writing!

## Science
Science is a subject we teach through interactive lessons and experiments!

## Coding
[Coding](https://ninjaspect.github.io/Coding) is probably the most unique aspect of Ninja Spect. We plan to provide future-programmers with high-quality logic skills and programming concepts through videos and projects. Soon enough we will have a code editor for developers!
